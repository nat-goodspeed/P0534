\abschnitt{Changed API}

As requested at the C++ meeting in Kona; free-functions \getdata and \dataavail
became member-functions of \cont. Additionally \cpp{operator(arg...)} and
\cpp{operator(invoke_ontop_arg,arg...)} have been renamed to \resume and
\resumewith.\\
\newline
Keeping \callcc as free-function is preferred because \cont represents a
continuation (a rest of a computation). In this context \callcc acts as a
factory-method, it creates and resumes a new execution context (stack etc.)
and if this execution context is suspended \callcc returns a continuation that
represents the rest of the computation.\\
The rest of the API remains a proposed in P0534R0\cite{P0534R0}.
