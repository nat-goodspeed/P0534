\abschnitt{Changed API}

As requested at the C++ meeting in Kona; free-functions \getdata and \dataavail
became member-functions of \cont. Additionally \cpp{operator(arg...)} and
\cpp{operator(invoke_ontop_arg,arg...)} have been renamed to \resume and
\resumewith.\\
\newline
Keeping \callcc as free-function is preferred because \cont represents a
continuation \footnote{A continuation is an abstract concept that represents the
context state at a given point during the execution of a program (for more
details see P0534R0, section \emph{Continuation}\cite{P0534R0})}.
In this context \callcc acts as a factory-method, it creates and resumes a new
execution context (stack etc.) and if this execution context is suspended
\callcc returns a continuation that represents the rest of the computation.\\
The rest of the API remains a proposed in P0534R0\cite{P0534R0}.
