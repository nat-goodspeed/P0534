\abschnitt{Changed API}

As requested at the C++ meeting in Kona; free-functions \getdata and \dataavail
became member-functions of \cont. Additionally \cpp{operator(arg...)} and
\cpp{operator(invoke_ontop_arg,arg...)} have been renamed to \resume and
\resumewith.\\
\newline
\callcc acts as a factory-method, it creates and starts a new execution context
(stack etc.) and returns a continuation that represents the rest of execution
context's computation \footnote{A continuation is an abstract concept that
represents the context state at a given point during the execution of a program
(for more details see P0534R0, section \emph{Continuation}\cite{P0534R0})}.\\
Additionally, \callcc express' explicitly the creation of a new execution
context and the switch to the other execution path.\\
\newline
Class \cpp{unwind\_exception} is used for unwinding and deallocating the stack
at continuation's destruction.\\
\newline
The rest of the API remains as proposed in P0534R0\cite{P0534R0}.
