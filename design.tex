\uabschnitt{\callcc as a factory function}

Every valid \cont instance is synthesized by the \callcc facility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item as a parameter passed into the function called by \callcc or \resumewith
    \item as the value returned by \callcc, \resume or \resumewith.
\end{itemize}

This is intentional for consistency with the \cc facility in other
languages.\cite{schemecallcc}\citecomma\cite{rubycallcc}


\uabschnitt{Footprint}

\cont contains only its \bfs{stack pointer} as member variable. It should
typically be no larger than one pointer.


\uabschnitt{Passing data}\label{subsec:data}

Data can be transfered between two continuations via global pointer, calling
wrappers (like \cpp{std::bind}) or lambda captures.
\cppf{passing_lambda}

The \cpp{callcc()} call at (0) enters the lambda and passes 1 into the
new context. The value is incremented by one, as shown by (1). The expression
\cpp{caller.resume()} at (2) resumes the original context (represented
within the lambda by \cpp{caller}).\\
The call to \cpp{lambda.resume()} at (3) resumes the lambda, returning from the
\cpp{caller.resume()} call at (2). We replace the \cont instance \cpp{caller}
invalidated by the \resume call at (2) with the new instance returned by that
same \resume call.\\
Finally the lambda returns (the updated) \cpp{caller} at (4), terminating its
context.\\

Since the updated \cpp{caller} represents the continuation suspended by the call at
(3), control returns to \main.\\

However, since context \cpp{lambda} has now terminated, the updated \cpp{lambda} is
invalid. Its \opbool returns \cpp{false}; its \cpp{operator\!()} returns
\cpp{true}.


\uabschnitt{main() and thread functions}\label{subsec:main}

\main as well as the \entryfn of a thread can be represented by a continuation.
That \cont instance is synthesized when the running context suspends, and is
passed into the newly-resumed context.
\cppf{simple}

The \cpp{callcc()} call at (0) enters the lambda. The \cont\ \cpp{caller} at (1)
represents the execution context of \main. Returning \cpp{caller} at (2) resumes the
original context, switching back to \main.


\uabschnitt{\cc and std::thread}

Any context represented by a valid \cont instance is necessarily suspended.\\

It is only valid to resume a \cont instance on the thread on which it was initially
launched.


\uabschnitt{Termination}

There are a few different ways to terminate a given context without
terminating the whole process, or engaging undefined behavior.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Return a valid continuation from the \entryfn.
    \item Call \unwindcont with a valid continuation. This throws a \unwindex
          instance that binds that continuation.
    \item \bfs{[LEWG: Should we publish the \unwindex constructor that
          accepts \cont? Then another supported way would be to construct and
          throw \unwindex ``by hand,'' which is what \unwindcont does internally.]}
    \item Call \cpp{std::continuation::resume\_with(std::unwind\_context)}.
          This is what \dtor does. Since \unwindcont accepts a \cont, and
          since \resumewith synthesizes a \cont and passes it to the subject function,
          this terminates the context referenced by the original \cont instance and
          switches back to the caller.
    \item Engage \dtor: switch to some other context, which will
          receive a \cont instance representing the current context. Make that other
          context destroy the received \cont instance.
\end{itemize}

When the \entryfn invoked by \callcc returns a valid \cont instance,
the running context is terminated. Control switches to the context
indicated by the returned \cont instance.\\

Returning an invalid \cont instance (\opbool returns \cpp{false}) invokes
undefined behavior.\\

If the \entryfn returns the same \cont instance it was originally
passed (or rather, the most recently updated \cont returned from \callcc or the
previous instance's \resume), control returns to the context that most
recently resumed the running context. However, the \entryfn may return (switch
to) any reachable valid \cont instance.\\

\emph{Calling} \contresume means: ``Please switch to the indicated context; I
am suspending; please resume me later.''\\

\emph{Returning} a particular \cont means: ``Please switch to the indicated
context; and by the way, I am done.''


\uabschnitt{Exceptions}\label{subsec:exceptions}

In general, if an uncaught exception escapes from the \entryfn,
\cpp{std::terminate} is called. There is one exception: \unwindex. The \callcc
facility internally uses \unwindex to clean up the stack of a suspended context
being destroyed. This exception must be allowed to propagate out of an \entryfn.\\

A correct \entryfn\ \cpp{try / catch} block looks like this:
\cppf{rethrow_unwind}

Of course, if you do not expect the \entryfn or anything it calls to throw
exceptions, you need no \cpp{try / catch} block.\\

If a \resumewith function throws an exception that you expect to catch in the
context's \entryfn, it is good practice to bind into the exception object the
continuation passed to the \resumewith function so that
the \entryfn's \cpp{catch} clause can return that continuation.


\uabschnitt{Inject function into suspended context}\label{subsec:resumewith}

Sometimes it is useful to inject a new function (for instance, to throw an
exception) into a suspended context. For this purpose you may call
\cpp{resume\_with(Fn && fn)}, passing the function \cpp{fn()} to execute.

Let's say that the context represented by the \cont instance \cpp{ctx} has
called a function \cpp{suspender()}, which has called \contresume and is now
suspended. You intend to inject function \cpp{fn()} into context \cpp{ctx} as
if \cpp{suspender()}'s \suspend call had directly called \cpp{fn()}.\\

Like an \entryfn passed to \callcc, \cpp{fn()} must accept
\cpp{std::continuation&&} and return \cont. The \cont instance returned
by \cpp{fn()} will, in turn, be returned to \cpp{suspender()} by its \suspend
call.

Suppose that code running on the program's main context
calls \cpp{std::callcc()}, thereby entering the first lambda shown below. This
is the point at which \cpp{mc} is synthesized and passed into the lambda at (0).

Suppose further that after doing some work ((1) through (5)), the lambda
calls \cpp{mc.resume()}, thereby switching back to the main context. The
lambda remains suspended in the call to \cpp{mc.resume()} at (6).

At (8) the main context calls \cpp{f\_ct.resume\_with()} where the passed
lambda accepts \cpp{continuation &&}. That new lambda is entered in the
context of the suspended lambda. It is as if the \cpp{mc.resume()} call at (6)
directly called the second lambda.\\

The function passed to \resumewith has almost the same range of possibilities
as any function called on the context represented by \cpp{f\_ct}. Its special
invocation matters when control leaves it in either of two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If it throws an exception, that exception unwinds all previous stack
        entries in that context (such as the first lambda's) as well, back to
        a matching \cpp{catch} clause.\footnote{As stated
        in \nameref{subsec:exceptions}, if there is no matching \cpp{catch}
        clause in that context, \cpp{std::terminate()} is called.}
  \item If the function returns, the returned \cont instance is returned by
        the suspended \cpp{mc.resume()} (or \callcc, or \resumewith) call.
\end{enumerate}

\cppf{ontop}

Control passes from (0) to (1) to (2), and so on.\\

The \cpp{f\_ct.resume\_with(<lambda>)} call at (8) passes control
to the second lamba on the context of the first lambda.\\

As usual, \resumewith synthesizes a \cont instance representing the calling
context, passed into the lambda as \cpp{mc}. This particular lambda
returns \cpp{mc} unchanged at (9); thus that \cpp{mc} instance is returned by
the \resume call at (6) and assigned at (10).\\

Finally, the first lambda returns at (12) the \cpp{mc} variable updated at
(10), switching back to the main context.


\uabschnitt{\callcc immediately enters new context}

\callcc creates a new context and immediately calls its passed \entryfn on
that new context.\\

This is intentional for consistency with the \cc facility in other
languages.\cite{schemecallcc}\citecomma\cite{rubycallcc}\\

Moreover, this behavior prevents a problematic usage. Suppose we had a
\cpp{callcc\_deferred()} which would create a new context but immediately
return to its caller. The newly-created context would first be entered by
calling \resume on the returned \cont instance.
\cppf{good_resume}
But now consider this scenario:
\cppf{bad_resume_with}
What should happen here?\\

\resumewith is supposed to call \cpp{injected\_function()} as if it had been
directly called by \cpp{entry\_function()} -- rather, by the context-switch
operation most recently executed by \cpp{entry\_function()}. But
since \cpp{entry\_function()} has never yet been entered, it hasn't executed
any context-switch operation. Indeed, it does not yet have a stack frame.\\

Should \cpp{injected\_function()} \emph{become} the \entryfn
for \cpp{newcontext}, displacing \cpp{entry\_function()} entirely?\\

With the present API, to quickly resume the caller's context rather than
prioritizing the new context, the \entryfn passed to \callcc can immediately
context-switch back to its caller by calling \resume on its passed-in \cont:
\cppf{quickly_resume}

A more generic wrapper for that behavior could look something like this:
\cppf{callcc_deferred}
Note that since \cpp{suspend\_immediately()} \emph{has} been entered, it
is perfectly valid for the caller of \cpp{callcc\_deferred()} to
call \resumewith on the returned \cont.


\uabschnitt{Stack destruction}\label{subsec:destruction}

On construction of a context with \callcc a stack is allocated. If the
\entryfn returns, the stack will be destroyed. If the function has not yet
returned and the \nameref{subpara:destructor} of the \cont instance
representing that context is called, the stack will be unwound and destroyed.\\

For this purpose member-function \resumewith is called with \unwindcont as
argument. The execution context will be temporarily resumed and \unwindcont is
invoked. Function \unwindcont throws exception \unwindex.
\footnote{\unwindex binds an instance of \cont that represents the continuation
that called \resumewith.}
The exception is caught by the first frame on the stack: the one created by
\callcc. Control is switched back to the context that called \dtor and the
stack gets deallocated.\\

The StackAllocator's deallocate operation is called on the context that invoked
\dtor.\\

The stack on which \cpp{main()} is executed, as well as the stack implicitly
created by \cpp{std::thread}'s constructor, is allocated by the operating
system. Such stacks are recognized by \cont, and are not deallocated by its
destructor.


\uabschnitt{Stack allocators}\label{subsec:stackalloc}

are used to create stacks.\\

Stack allocators might implement arbitrary stack strategies. For instance, a
stack allocator might append a guard page at the end of the stack, or cache
stacks for reuse, or create stacks that grow on demand.\\

Because stack allocators are provided by the implementation, and are only used
as parameters of \callcc, the StackAllocator concept is an implementation detail,
used only by the internal mechanisms of the \cc implementation. Different
implementations might use different StackAllocator concepts.\\

However, when an implementation provides a stack allocator matching one of
the descriptions below, it should use the specified name.\\

Possible types of stack allocators:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cpp{protected\_fixedsize}: The constructor accepts a \cpp{size\_t}
          parameter. This stack allocator constructs a contiguous stack of
          specified size, appending a guard page at the end to protect against
          overflow. If the guard page is accessed (read or write operation), a
          segmentation fault/access violation is generated by the operating
          system.
    \item \cpp{fixedsize}: The constructor accepts a \cpp{size\_t} parameter.
          This stack allocator constructs a contiguous stack of specified size.
          In contrast to \cpp{protected\_fixedsize}, it does not append a guard
          page. The memory is simply managed by \cpp{std::malloc()}
          and \cpp{std::free()}, avoiding kernel involvement.
    \item \cpp{segmented}: The constructor accepts a \cpp{size\_t} parameter.
          This stack allocator creates a segmented stack\cite{gccsplit} with the
          specified initial size, which grows on demand.\footnote{An
          implementation of the \cpp{segmented} StackAllocator necessarily
          interacts with the C++ runtime. For instance, with gcc, the
          Boost.Context\cite{bcontext} library invokes
          the \cpp{\_\_splitstack\_makecontext()}
          and \cpp{\_\_splitstack\_releasecontext()} intrinsic
          functions.\cite{splitalloc}\citecomma\cite{bctxseg}}
\end{itemize}

It is expected that the StackAllocator's allocation operation will run in the
context of the \callcc call (before control is passed to the new context), and
that the StackAllocator's deallocation operation will run in the context of
the \dtor call (after control returns from the destroyed
context). No special constraints need apply to either operation.
