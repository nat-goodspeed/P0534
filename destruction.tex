\abschnitt{Stack destruction}

If an instance of \cont goes out of scope and the aggregated stack-pointer is
not \nullptr\footnote{That means that the computation was not finished, hence
the execution context was suspended in a deep call-stack.}, the stack gets
unwound and deallocated.\\
For this purpose member-function \resumewith is caleld with as special function
(let's call it \unwindfn) as argument. The execution context will be
resumed and \unwindfn is invoked. Function \unwindfn does throw exception
\unwindex\footnote{\unwindex gets an instance of \cont that represents the
continuation that has called the destructor as argument.}. The exception
is catched by the first frame on the stack (the one that was created by
\callcc). The execution path is switched back to the context that has called
\cpp{\~continuation()} and the stack gets deallocated.
