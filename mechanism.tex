\abschnitt{The context switch mechanism}
Calling convention, part of the ABI, covers how function's arguments are passed
and return values retrieved; which CPU registers have to be preserved by the
called subroutine (scratch vs. called-saved registers).\\

The calling convention of SYSV ABI for x86\_64 architecture determines that CPU
registers R12, R13, R14, R15, RBX and RBP have to be preserved during a function
call. The arguments are passed via RDI, RSI and RAX, RDX are used for return
values.
